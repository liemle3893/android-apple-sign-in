# üìÑ Product Requirements Document: Android App with Sign In with Apple Support

## 1. üìå Overview
This document defines the product requirements for an Android application that enables users to sign in using Apple ID (Sign In with Apple). The goal is to offer a privacy-focused, secure, and user-friendly authentication method aligned with Apple's guidelines.

## 2. üéØ Objectives
- Implement Sign In with Apple on Android using the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards.
- Allow users to authenticate seamlessly using their Apple ID.
- Ensure privacy compliance (email relay, anonymous sign-in, etc.).
- Integrate the sign-in flow into the app's existing authentication system.

## 3. ÔøΩ Target Users
- Users with Apple IDs who want to sign in to the Android app securely.
- Users who prefer privacy-preserving sign-in options.

## 4. üõ† Key Features

### 4.1 Sign In with Apple Flow
- Display a "Sign in with Apple" button (per Apple's UI guidelines).
- Redirect to Apple's OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint in a secure browser (Custom Tab or WebView).
- Receive authorization code and ID token.
- Exchange code with Apple token endpoint to retrieve access and refresh tokens.
- Validate ID token (JWT).
- Parse user info: sub, email, name.

### 4.2 Backend Integration
- Send Apple ID token to backend for verification.
- Create or link a user account using Apple's unique user ID (sub claim).
- Store minimal info (email, name if available).

### 4.3 Anonymous/Private Relay Email Support
- Support the option for users to hide their email (private relay).
- Route communications via Apple relay if used.

### 4.4 Error Handling
- Handle revoked tokens, expired sessions, and user cancellation.
- Fallback if Apple sign-in is not available.

## 5. üîê Security & Compliance
- Use HTTPS only.
- Store tokens securely using Android Keystore / EncryptedSharedPreferences.
- Validate JWT signature using Apple's public key.
- Follow Apple's Sign In with Apple Human Interface Guidelines and Security Best Practices.
